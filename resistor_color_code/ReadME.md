## Description

Resistors are electronic components that limit or regulate the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit. Their resistance value is often indicated by a series of colored bands. This project aims to provide a convenient way to interpret these color codes and determine the resistance value, tolerance, and temperature coefficient of a resistor.

## Features

- **Color Code to Value Conversion**: Input the colors of the bands and get the resistance value.
- **Value to Color Code Conversion (Planned)**: (Future feature) Input a resistance value and get the corresponding color code.
- **User-friendly Interface**: (Depending on implementation, e.g., command-line, GUI, web)

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fatihaksoy/resistor_color_code.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd resistor_color_code
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   (Add specific installation instructions here if your project has dependencies, e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python)

## Usage

(Provide clear instructions on how to use your tool. For example, if it's a Python script:)

To decode a resistor color code, run the main script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python main.py
